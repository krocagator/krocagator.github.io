For the ask: "Solve for X" - The name of a former Google think thank, and inadvertently a billboard question from Google.

If you set up the equation traditionally, with Y = X, it appears that you neither have x nor y and the problem is insolveable. However, the understood ask is from the purpose of the think tank and the mission statement of Google X itself. X in this case is to be a 'collaborative solution to global issues and support for innovators' and a 'moonshot technology to make the world a radically better place.' This singular problem (Y) stems from Google's mission statement, to 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'

So what value for X can possibly solve for Google's implicit Y? What one technology, innovation or collaborative solution can solve for Y?

In the first solution, which is the solution attempted by participants of Google X and the Solve for X think tank, we attempt to find many possible solutions for Y (technologies, innovations, collaborations).

X = airborn balloons to deliever internet (loon)
X = drones to deliever medical equipment (wing)
X = remote wind power (makani)

etc.

In each of these cases, albeit brilliant and a fun engineering challenge, Y ≠ X.
A singular value for X does not encompass the broad scope of Google's big ask.

Instead, they are solving for an infinite number of "y"s, with a finite number of "x"s.

y1 = access to internet, solved by x1 = loon
y2 = access to medical supplies, solved by x2 = wing
y3 = remote access to power, solved by x3 = makani

The "y"s being infinite, as there are an infinite number of ways humans might want to make the world a radically better place. The "x"s being very large but possibly finite, as there are limited Resources and Time to make the world a radically better place. I say finite time, because the current World they are attempting to change is changing rapidly and the solutions needed today will not necessarily be relevant in the future.

Thus generates the first equation to the ask Solve for X gives us the equation:
Y ≠ X

I.e. there is no one solution X that can possibly solve for Y. We take the equation down into smaller, radically bite sized pieces and try to solve y1, y2, y3 with things like x1, x2, x2. Which is noble, but is not the answer to the question. It essentially creates an infinite number of solutions.

The second solution is a bit of a leap:

Here's how it goes.
We set Y = =
This is implicit in the mission statements for Google, Google X and the Solve for X thinktank.
We have access to internet, they do not. We have access to medical supplies, they do not. We have access to information, they do not. We have access to electrical power, they do not. They are being most affected by climate change, we are not.  In all of Google's solutions to a better world, there is a root of attempting to solve for equality. Whether that is social or environmental justice, it is there.

Plugging in the value of Y back into our first equation, 
we get = ≠ X,
or X = ≠

And we have two independent equations:
X = ≠
Y = =

I am deficient on a half a cup of coffee grown somewhere in the world that isn't my backyard, but let's see if this holds.
Solve for X was a "collaborative solution" to the world's problem, with only a few intellectual elite invited to participate. Google X generates products and ideas to solve the world's problems, but does not make participation open, and I believe little open-source code, designs, schematics. Google's search engine algorithms are proprietery, along with many other patents under Alphabet's umbrella. 

It would seem therefore that they are solving for equalities with inequalities.

Does = = ≠ ?

Mathematically, not it does not. But if you market it correctly? No, mathematically it still does not.

I would bet with mathematical certainty that the current Google/Google X complex will not save the world. I would also bet that a "collaborative solution to global issues and support for innovators" with "universal access to information" might radically help the world.
