There is a story in Silicon Valley, daresay a legend, of extremely difficult mathematics equations being posted on billboards along the freeway. Those who could answer them first correctly, would be offered a job at Google.

In 2012 Google announced the start of a think tank, entitled Solve for X. Solve for X “was a community solution engagement project and think tank-like event launched by Google to encourage collaboration, solve global issues and support innovators.

I took this "Solve for X" as an inadvertent billboard question (an ask) from Google, and I began to ponder the value for Y.

If you set up the equation traditionally, with Y = X, it appears that you neither have x nor y and the problem is unsolvable. However, the understood ask is from the purpose of the event and Google X itself. X in this case it is to be a 'collaborative solution to global issues and support for innovators' and a 'moonshot technology to make the world a radically better place.' For myself, I looked at Y and obviously Y = save the world. Preventing global ecosystem collapse and seeing civilization enter a new sustainable age.

So what value for X can possibly equal Y?

I looked to Google X, and their values for both X and Y.

X = airborne balloons to deliver internet (loon)
X = drones to deliver medical equipment (wing)
X = remote wind power (makani)

In each of these cases Y = X. A singular value for X, to attempt to solve a global issue.

Y1 = access to internet, to be solved by X1 = loon
Y2 = access to medical supplies, to be solved by X2 = wing
Y3 = remote access to power, to be solved by X3 = makani

They are solving for an infinite number of "Y"s, with a finite number of "X"s. The "Y"s being infinite, as there are an infinite number of ways humans might want to make the world a radically better place. The "X"s being very large but finite, as there are limited resources and time. I say finite time, because the current world is changing rapidly and the solutions needed today will not necessarily be relevant in the future.

For myself, my Y is set at saving the world - preventing total ecosystem collapse and pushing civilization into a broad, new sustainable dawn. It is quite the “global issue” to set for Y, but I had some ideas. However, there is no one solution X that can possibly solve for my Y. I can take the equation down into smaller, radically bite sized pieces and solve for smaller Y’s with smaller X’s. Ideas in oceanic energy upgrades, ideas in community engagement x plant DNA sequencing, ideas of just finding someone smarter and more passionate than myself and working on their X and Y. All of these seemed noble and possibly making a dent in my own value for Y, but it did not solve the equation.

Thus generates my first equation to the ask Solve for X gives us the equation:



Looking at the missions for Google and Google X again, we set Y = = and Y = ≠

This is implicit. We have access to internet, they do not. We have access to medical supplies, they do not. We have access to information, they do not. We have access to electrical power, they do not. They are being most affected by climate change, we are not. In all of these solutions to a better world, there is a root of attempting to solve for inequalities. Whether that is social or environmental justice, it is there.

I then looked at my value for Y and ideas for a possible X. Humanity is valued much more highly than the ecosystems on which we depend (an inequality), the under and overuse of certain energy technologies (an inequality), the value of goods considered sustainable (an inequality), participation in conservation and sustainability versus many other disciplines and careers (an inequality), the funding of conservation and sustainability versus other pursuits of humankind (an inequality).

Looking at these equations, and my own experiences in life, I see that I need to solve for the equality and inequality of people and the rest of the planet of which we are so much a part. We must use equality to solve for inequalities.

Y ≠ X

Y = =
Y = ≠

∴ X = ≠, X = =
